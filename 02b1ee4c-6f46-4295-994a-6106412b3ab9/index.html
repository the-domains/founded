<p>GROWING UP ON THE OUTER EDGES OF PARIS, CAMILLE TANOH FOUND HIS NICHE WORKING FOR PIERRE HARDY AND PAUL SMITH. NOW HE’S BLAZING A PATH FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF FRENCH DESIGNERS.
With a rigorous sense of aesthetics and a dynamic motivation to succeed, Camille Tanoh is a Parisian shoe designer who makes footwear for the city’s creative strivers. He began working in the fashion industry as a model when he was 17 before becoming a press assistant for Paul Smith, Balenciaga and Pierre Hardy. Now 26 and a part-time New Yorker, Camille regularly returns home to Paris where he’s developed his own line of shoes and is working on a music project. (He also continues to consult for Pierre Hardy, who has become his mentor and teacher.) Camille aspires to communicate a sense of freedom and possibility through his work, especially to the young generation he grew up with in the bridled reality of the banlieues—the outskirts of the city—where opportunity and information are scarce. As the French-born son of immigrants from Ivory Coast, Camille relishes the chance to break new ground and to help define the next era of Parisian design.
—
For me, Paris is like a museum, but it’s always the same exhibition. At first it’s amazing, but you need to leave and see some other “exhibitions” to appreciate it. Even though I grew up in Paris, it’s still a very hard city, especially when you want to do something a little different. Paris is about the old fashion houses and the old ways. They say you have to make it in New York to prove yourself, but Paris is much more difficult: I think you have to make it in Paris.
I come from the projects in France: the banlieues. In the banlieues, you don’t know about the opera, you don’t know about Sciences Po [Paris Institute of Political Studies] and the top universities—you have to figure everything out for yourself.
Coming from where I was from, I knew I was different. I liked to go to museums, my name was different, and I was the kind of kid who would get picked on. But when I started working with Pierre Hardy, I found somebody who loves the stuff that I do. It turns out I like to do what a white, 60-year-old man likes to do: go to museums, read books, study architecture… I think more people could warm up to these experiences if they were exposed to them. I’d like to see different races and different ages at fashion shows—not just the typical people who get to go to them. And I want to encourage more people to go to museums. People should be comfortable with art in general, because art is how we question culture.
At Pierre Hardy, I learned that the design process can start in different ways. Pierre would get inspired by a book, a magazine or a song, and then he’d use his ability to verbalize feelings and color to turn that inspiration into reality. For example, he’d get inspired by the Italian designer Ettore Sottsass and turn that inspiration into a shoe. When I started working with Pierre, I realized that I wasn’t crazy! I’ve learned so much about culture from Pierre—and confidence, too.
Fashion is very important to me; it’s a platform for me to express myself. My clothes need to represent what I want to say before I actually speak, as fashion is the only way I can defend myself before I open my mouth. Paris is so judgmental and conservative—especially when you’re black—so clothes were the tool I could use to get people’s attention, to be seen as cool and to get my chance. Here in France, I’m part of the first generation born to African immigrants. We don’t have a lot of black lawyers or black doctors yet, so having a black designer doing things you don’t expect is unusual. As a black shoe designer, I’ve got a purpose: I need to show what’s possible. I’m trying to push the culture forward and break boundaries.
Except for Apple, Nike and NASA, no one is creating anything new nowadays. But we can create stories, and I think people are buying stories. The Monday Morning Man, my latest shoe design, is about someone independent, someone who makes their own schedule, someone who accomplishes what they want to accomplish. Our society is all about time, and Monday has a special meaning for everyone. I wanted to create a pair of shoes that would define this attitude of how people start their week.
The film I made to tell the story of the Monday Morning Man shoe is full of my friends—artists, designers, models—people who are doing things, but not in a traditional office. It was also inspired by On Kawara, who is one of my favorite artists: He sent postcards for his “I got up…” series to friends and artists, and I took those times and put them in the shoes. You won’t find my name in the shoes—you’ll just see the inscription: “Today I got up at 7:47” or “Today I got up at 9:45.” There’s no branding anywhere.
Brands today want to turn you into a walking billboard. Quiet branding is a way to stand out, so I apply the principles of minimalism to my designs. You have to go through a complex process to get to simplicity; you have to try a lot of prototypes. Simple means something that makes complete sense.
I really don’t care about fashion seasons—seasons are a tyranny. I only make a permanent collection by releasing a new product every month in a different material and with a different story. Store buyers don’t want to take risks with new designers: They want you to do consignment, they want new pieces four times a year… but I really don’t need the stores. I’m doing everything for myself.
Most people work a regular job, but I think more people should start their own businesses. I can work with somebody, but I can’t work for somebody. If I’m hired by somebody, it’s to accomplish that person’s dreams, but I have dreams too. It’s three times harder going solo, though. My mom would always tell me that as a black person, you need to speak better English, dress better and do everything three times better. On top of all that, I need to work three times harder, because I don’t have the power of LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE) or any big companies backing me up.
Some friends and I started a movement called <a href="http://P.L.US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P.L.US</a>. It stands for Paris Loves Us, and we aim at sharing positivity through art, music and fashion. There are 12 members and we see each other or have a Skype call every Sunday. It’s really positive. We have members designing for Saint Laurent, Givenchy and Pigalle, and a lot of us have come from the banlieues. I was once a kid looking for information, so now it’s my responsibility to say, “Here’s what you can do, here are the ways you can do things, here’s the type of confidence you need to have.”
We mainly want to share experiences and information with each other. If somebody wants to start a line of clothes or shoes, we can help them—there’s no competition. Otherwise, how can you find a shoe factory? How can you put your shoes into stores? How can you put together a press list? It’s pretty hard, and it has nothing to do with skin color or geography—it’s just access to the information. The internet can tell you what to do, but it won’t tell you where or how. So we share, and we’ve already seen the results. It’s a big birthday cake and everyone can have a piece. We’re trying to find the Parisian dream.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

UP ON THE OUTER EDGES OF PARIS, CAMILLE TANOH FOUND HIS NICHE WORKING FOR PIERRE HARDY AND PAUL SMITH. NOW HE’S BLAZING A PATH FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF FRENCH DESIGNERS.\nWith a rigorous sense of aesthetics and a dynamic motivation to succeed, Camille Tanoh is a Parisian shoe designer who makes footwear for the city’s creative strivers. He began working in the fashion industry as a model when he was 17 before becoming a press assistant for Paul Smith, Balenciaga and Pierre Hardy. Now 26 and a part-time New Yorker, Camille regularly returns home to Paris where he’s developed his own line of shoes and is working on a music project. (He also continues to consult for Pierre Hardy, who has become his mentor and teacher.) Camille aspires to communicate a sense of freedom and possibility through his work, especially to the young generation he grew up with in the bridled reality of the banlieues—the outskirts of the city—where opportunity and information are scarce. As the French-born son of immigrants from Ivory Coast, Camille relishes the chance to break new ground and to help define the next era of Parisian design.\n—\nFor me, Paris is like a museum, but it’s always the same exhibition. At first it’s amazing, but you need to leave and see some other “exhibitions” to appreciate it. Even though I grew up in Paris, it’s still a very hard city, especially when you want to do something a little different. Paris is about the old fashion houses and the old ways. They say you have to make it in New York to prove yourself, but Paris is much more difficult: I think you have to make it in Paris.\nI come from the projects in France: the banlieues. In the banlieues, you don’t know about the opera, you don’t know about Sciences Po [Paris Institute of Political Studies] and the top universities—you have to figure everything out for yourself.\nComing from where I was from, I knew I was different. I liked to go to museums, my name was different, and I was the kind of kid who would get picked on. But when I started working with Pierre Hardy, I found somebody who loves the stuff that I do. It turns out I like to do what a white, 60-year-old man likes to do: go to museums, read books, study architecture… I think more people could warm up to these experiences if they were exposed to them. I’d like to see different races and different ages at fashion shows—not just the typical people who get to go to them. And I want to encourage more people to go to museums. People should be comfortable with art in general, because art is how we question culture.\nAt Pierre Hardy, I learned that the design process can start in different ways. Pierre would get inspired by a book, a magazine or a song, and then he’d use his ability to verbalize feelings and color to turn that inspiration into reality. For example, he’d get inspired by the Italian designer Ettore Sottsass and turn that inspiration into a shoe. When I started working with Pierre, I realized that I wasn’t crazy! I’ve learned so much about culture from Pierre—and confidence, too.\nFashion is very important to me; it’s a platform for me to express myself. My clothes need to represent what I want to say before I actually speak, as fashion is the only way I can defend myself before I open my mouth. Paris is so judgmental and conservative—especially when you’re black—so clothes were the tool I could use to get people’s attention, to be seen as cool and to get my chance. Here in France, I’m part of the first generation born to African immigrants. We don’t have a lot of black lawyers or black doctors yet, so having a black designer doing things you don’t expect is unusual. As a black shoe designer, I’ve got a purpose: I need to show what’s possible. I’m trying to push the culture forward and break boundaries.\nExcept for Apple, Nike and NASA, no one is creating anything new nowadays. But we can create stories, and I think people are buying stories. The Monday Morning Man, my latest shoe design, is about someone independent, someone who makes their own schedule, someone who accomplishes what they want to accomplish. Our society is all about time, and Monday has a special meaning for everyone. I wanted to create a pair of shoes that would define this attitude of how people start their week.\nThe film I made to tell the story of the Monday Morning Man shoe is full of my friends—artists, designers, models—people who are doing things, but not in a traditional office. It was also inspired by On Kawara, who is one of my favorite artists: He sent postcards for his “I got up…” series to friends and artists, and I took those times and put them in the shoes. You won’t find my name in the shoes—you’ll just see the inscription: “Today I got up at 7:47” or “Today I got up at 9:45.” There’s no branding anywhere.\nBrands today want to turn you into a walking billboard. Quiet branding is a way to stand out, so I apply the principles of minimalism to my designs. You have to go through a complex process to get to simplicity; you have to try a lot of prototypes. Simple means something that makes complete sense.\nI really don’t care about fashion seasons—seasons are a tyranny. I only make a permanent collection by releasing a new product every month in a different material and with a different story. Store buyers don’t want to take risks with new designers: They want you to do consignment, they want new pieces four times a year… but I really don’t need the stores. I’m doing everything for myself.\nMost people work a regular job, but I think more people should start their own businesses. I can work with somebody, but I can’t work for somebody. If I’m hired by somebody, it’s to accomplish that person’s dreams, but I have dreams too. It’s three times harder going solo, though. My mom would always tell me that as a black person, you need to speak better English, dress better and do everything three times better. On top of all that, I need to work three times harder, because I don’t have the power of LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE) or any big companies backing me up.\nSome friends and I started a movement called P.L.US. It stands for Paris Loves Us, and we aim at sharing positivity through art, music and fashion. There are 12 members and we see each other or have a Skype call every Sunday. It’s really positive. We have members designing for Saint Laurent, Givenchy and Pigalle, and a lot of us have come from the banlieues. I was once a kid looking for information, so now it’s my responsibility to say, “Here’s what you can do, here are the ways you can do things, here’s the type of confidence you need to have.”\nWe mainly want to share experiences and information with each other. If somebody wants to start a line of clothes or shoes, we can help them—there’s no competition. Otherwise, how can you find a shoe factory? How can you put your shoes into stores? How can you put together a press list? It’s pretty hard, and it has nothing to do with skin color or geography—it’s just access to the information. The internet can tell you what to do, but it won’t tell you where or how. So we share, and we’ve already seen the results. It’s a big birthday cake and everyone can have a piece. We’re trying to find the Parisian dream.","_html":"<p>GROWING UP ON THE OUTER EDGES OF PARIS, CAMILLE TANOH FOUND HIS NICHE WORKING FOR PIERRE HARDY AND PAUL SMITH.

He began working in the fashion industry as a model when he was 17 before becoming a press assistant for Paul Smith, Balenciaga and Pierre Hardy. Now 26 and a part-time New Yorker, Camille regularly returns home to Paris where he’s developed his own line of shoes and is working on a music project. (He also continues to consult for Pierre Hardy, who has become his mentor and teacher.) Camille aspires to communicate a sense of freedom and possibility through his work, especially to the young generation he grew up with in the bridled reality of the banlieues—the outskirts of the city—where opportunity and information are scarce. As the French-born son of immigrants from Ivory Coast, Camille relishes the chance to break new ground and to help define the next era of Parisian design.\n—\nFor me, Paris is like a museum, but it’s always the same exhibition. At first it’s amazing, but you need to leave and see some other “exhibitions” to appreciate it. Even though I grew up in Paris, it’s still a very hard city, especially when you want to do something a little different. Paris is about the old fashion houses and the old ways. They say you have to make it in New York to prove yourself, but Paris is much more difficult: I think you have to make it in Paris.\nI come from the projects in France: the banlieues. In the banlieues, you don’t know about the opera, you don’t know about Sciences Po [Paris Institute of Political Studies] and the top universities—you have to figure everything out for yourself.\nComing from where I was from, I knew I was different. I liked to go to museums, my name was different, and I was the kind of kid who would get picked on. But when I started working with Pierre Hardy, I found somebody who loves the stuff that I do. It turns out I like to do what a white, 60-year-old man likes to do: go to museums, read books, study architecture… I think more people could warm up to these experiences if they were exposed to them. I’d like to see different races and different ages at fashion shows—not just the typical people who get to go to them. And I want to encourage more people to go to museums. People should be comfortable with art in general, because art is how we question culture.\nAt Pierre Hardy, I learned that the design process can start in different ways. Pierre would get inspired by a book, a magazine or a song, and then he’d use his ability to verbalize feelings and color to turn that inspiration into reality. For example, he’d get inspired by the Italian designer Ettore Sottsass and turn that inspiration into a shoe. When I started working with Pierre, I realized that I wasn’t crazy! I’ve learned so much about culture from Pierre—and confidence, too.\nFashion is very important to me; it’s a platform for me to express myself. My clothes need to represent what I want to say before I actually speak, as fashion is the only way I can defend myself before I open my mouth. Paris is so judgmental and conservative—especially when you’re black—so clothes were the tool I could use to get people’s attention, to be seen as cool and to get my chance. Here in France, I’m part of the first generation born to African immigrants. We don’t have a lot of black lawyers or black doctors yet, so having a black designer doing things you don’t expect is unusual. As a black shoe designer, I’ve got a purpose: I need to show what’s possible. I’m trying to push the culture forward and break boundaries.\nExcept for Apple, Nike and NASA, no one is creating anything new nowadays. But we can create stories, and I think people are buying stories. The Monday Morning Man, my latest shoe design, is about someone independent, someone who makes their own schedule, someone who accomplishes what they want to accomplish. Our society is all about time, and Monday has a special meaning for everyone. I wanted to create a pair of shoes that would define this attitude of how people start their week.\nThe film I made to tell the story of the Monday Morning Man shoe is full of my friends—artists, designers, models—people who are doing things, but not in a traditional office. It was also inspired by On Kawara, who is one of my favorite artists: He sent postcards for his “I got up…” series to friends and artists, and I took those times and put them in the shoes. You won’t find my name in the shoes—you’ll just see the inscription: “Today I got up at 7:47” or “Today I got up at 9:45.” There’s no branding anywhere.\nBrands today want to turn you into a walking billboard. Quiet branding is a way to stand out, so I apply the principles of minimalism to my designs. You have to go through a complex process to get to simplicity; you have to try a lot of prototypes. Simple means something that makes complete sense.\nI really don’t care about fashion seasons—seasons are a tyranny. I only make a permanent collection by releasing a new product every month in a different material and with a different story. Store buyers don’t want to take risks with new designers: They want you to do consignment, they want new pieces four times a year… but I really don’t need the stores. I’m doing everything for myself.\nMost people work a regular job, but I think more people should start their own businesses. I can work with somebody, but I can’t work for somebody. If I’m hired by somebody, it’s to accomplish that person’s dreams, but I have dreams too. It’s three times harder going solo, though. My mom would always tell me that as a black person, you need to speak better English, dress better and do everything three times better. On top of all that, I need to work three times harder, because I don’t have the power of LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE) or any big companies backing me up.\nSome friends and I started a movement called P.L.US. It stands for Paris Loves Us, and we aim at sharing positivity through art, music and fashion. There are 12 members and we see each other or have a Skype call every Sunday. It’s really positive. We have members designing for Saint Laurent, Givenchy and Pigalle, and a lot of us have come from the banlieues. I was once a kid looking for information, so now it’s my responsibility to say, “Here’s what you can do, here are the ways you can do things, here’s the type of confidence you need to have.”\nWe mainly want to share experiences and information with each other. If somebody wants to start a line of clothes or shoes, we can help them—there’s no competition. Otherwise, how can you find a shoe factory? How can you put your shoes into stores? How can you put together a press list? It’s pretty hard, and it has nothing to do with skin color or geography—it’s just access to the information. The internet can tell you what to do, but it won’t tell you where or how. So we share, and we’ve already seen the results. It’s a big birthday cake and everyone can have a piece. We’re trying to find the Parisian dream.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}}]},"site-footer-item":{"id":"site-footer-item","index":3,"metadata":{"@type":"footer","starred":true},"content":[{"id":"site-footer-block","type":"footer","_html":"","metadata":{"starred":true},"footer":{"rss":{"href":"rss.xml","rel":"alternate","title":"Founded
